# AngularSignals

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.3.

This Angular project is based on the course <span class="tw-italic tw-font-semibold">RxJS and Angular Signals Fundamentals*</span>
and focuses on the integration of reactive programming techniques using RxJS and signals in modern Angular applications.
The project demonstrates how to handle asynchronous data streams and signals effectively, improving performance
and user experience. It includes the use of services and observables for managing state, data fetching, and event
handling, emphasizing the declarative approach for handling side effects. The project implements components that
interact with RxJS streams to display real-time updates, such as product listings or notifications. It also explores
error handling strategies with RxJS and Angular's HttpClient. Tailwind CSS is integrated for styling, although
responsive design was not the main focus. The project's primary goal was mastering reactive programming concepts,
and the codebase follows best practices for TypeScript and Angular, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
The structure promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase easy to extend and test.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
